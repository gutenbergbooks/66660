<p class="p4"><span class="lrgfont"><i>When</i></span> polio strikes some child in a community,
it is only natural for all parents in that
community to become concerned about their
own children. It is well to keep in mind, however,
that even during an epidemic the number
of persons who get the disease is very small in
comparison with the total population. For example,
approximately 45,000 cases were reported
for the entire United States and Canada
in 1949—and this was a bad year.</p>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_p01">
  <img src="images/i_p01.jpg"
       alt="active children"
       title="active children" />
</div>

<p>Furthermore, about 50% of those who get polio
seriously enough to become paralyzed recover
completely. Another large group has very slight
after-effects. Comparatively few are seriously
affected by the disease, and many of these can
be considerably improved by means of surgery
and prolonged special treatment. Very few
cases end fatally.</p>

<p>This does not mean, however, that polio can
safely be ignored. The disease is a serious one—it
is the most frequent cause of deformity in
children—and wise parents will take every possible
precaution to help their children avoid
contracting it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span></p>


<h2 class="nobreak"><i>What is</i> POLIO?</h2>

<p>It is a contagious disease in
which the gray matter of the
spinal cord is attacked, producing
destruction of certain cells
and causing paralysis. The disease
is caused by a virus—tiny
“bugs” smaller than bacteria.
Apparently these “bugs” enter
through the mouth on food or
in water that has been contaminated
in some fashion, or
through the nose in breathing.
It is not conclusively known how the disease is
spread. Many people harbor the virus without
any reaction whatsoever. Many others have
mild symptoms which they disregard as a summer
cold. Once symptoms have developed, special
laboratory studies made by experts are
usually carried out to establish the diagnosis
accurately.</p>


<h2 class="nobreak"><i>What are the</i> SYMPTOMS?</h2>

<p>There is no characteristic symptom
or sign to be found in all
cases. This makes the diagnosis
difficult. Quite frequently, the
patient cannot bend his head
forward as far as usual. A doctor
should always be called if
anyone in the family has a
fever associated with a bad
headache, or with pain in the
muscles in either the arms or
legs or in the neck and back.
Even minor upsets in children should be looked
upon with suspicion. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
a slight cold coupled with pain in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
joints, are also possible danger signs. A child
catching polio may become drowsy or restless,
feverish and irritable. He may complain about
and resist being moved. These symptoms are
particularly important during the summer and
early fall months because this is the period during
which most outbreaks of polio occur.</p>


<h2 class="nobreak"><i>What is the</i> TREATMENT?</h2>

<p>If, during the course of an epidemic,
any suspicious illness
should develop in a member of
your family, prompt medical
attention and observation are
important. If any sign or symptom
of polio is present, the affected
person should be hospitalized
immediately. Hospitals
have many special forms
of equipment which are necessary
in treatment. Trained nursing
care is essential. Should paralysis appear,
special measures are necessary to prevent or
lessen deformity and to begin the rebuilding of
the affected parts of the body. No clearly reliable
specific drug is available as yet which will
cure polio, but gamma globulin appears to give
some degree of protection for several weeks
against the paralysis stage of the disease. There
are now strong hopes that a vaccine is now
available that will give immunity against polio
for a whole season.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="lrgfont"><i>At the present time</i></span> treatment of the disease
takes many forms. While a patient is recovering
from a polio attack, a full nourishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
diet, application of various forms of heat and
massage, special baths and exercises, are the
measures which are most helpful in restoring
usefulness to affected arms or legs. Specially
built shoes or braces are required in only a few
cases, and surgical operations have been devised
to return motion and function to the arms
or legs of some patients.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="lrgfont"><i>Treatment</i></span> must be continued over long periods
of time in some cases, but the results are
often very rewarding. The expense of such long
treatment is great. Fortunately, an awakened
public, through its contributions to the National
Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and other
Agencies, has helped thousands to bear this
expense. Support of these organizations in their
sincere and unselfish aims is a splendid public
service in the battle against polio.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>How to GUARD against
this DISEASE....</i></h2>

<p>Although there is no known means of vaccination
or inoculation against polio, many things
can be done to lessen the possibility of getting
the disease.</p>


<p><span class="lrgfont"><i>First</i></span> of all, if an epidemic occurs, you
should follow the instructions of the local public
health officer. He will also decide in what cases
gamma globulin is needed.</p>


<p><span class="lrgfont"><i>Secondly</i>,</span> it is wise to avoid crowded places,
especially indoors where there is opportunity for
close contact and possible infection.</p>


<p><span class="lrgfont"><i>In addition</i>,</span> food and water should be obtained
only from absolutely reliable sources.</p>


<p><span class="lrgfont"><i>Every</i></span> effort should be made to insure that
flies, mice, rats, and other vermin are kept out
of the home, as they are possible carriers of
infection.</p>


<p><span class="lrgfont"><i>You</i></span> and your children should get plenty of rest
and wholesome food, avoid over-exertion and
excessive fatigue.</p>


<p><span class="lrgfont"><i>Do not</i></span> travel into areas where there is much
polio or go swimming when many cases have
occurred in your locality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>


<p class="p2"><span class="lrgfont"><i>Further</i>,</span> many physicians may advise postponing
the removal of tonsils, the extraction of
teeth, or other operations in or about the nose,
throat, or mouth when the disease is prevalent
in the community.</p>

</div>

<p>The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis
and other Agencies will help polio patients as
much as possible. But the best kind of help is
that which you, yourself, can give by taking
every precaution to keep the disease from striking
anyone in your family. Proper rest, a balanced
diet, and moderate exercise in the fresh
air and sunshine tone up the body and help increase
the system’s resistance to disease. By following
these and other common-sense rules of
wholesome living, your family will be taking a
major step toward health and happiness.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
