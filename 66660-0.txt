_When_ polio strikes some child in a community, it is only natural
for all parents in that community to become concerned about their
own children. It is well to keep in mind, however, that even during
an epidemic the number of persons who get the disease is very small
in comparison with the total population. For example, approximately
45,000 cases were reported for the entire United States and Canada in
1949――and this was a bad year.

Furthermore, about 50% of those who get polio seriously enough to
become paralyzed recover completely. Another large group has very
slight after-effects. Comparatively few are seriously affected by the
disease, and many of these can be considerably improved by means of
surgery and prolonged special treatment. Very few cases end fatally.

This does not mean, however, that polio can safely be ignored. The
disease is a serious one――it is the most frequent cause of deformity in
children――and wise parents will take every possible precaution to help
their children avoid contracting it.


                           _What is_ POLIO?

It is a contagious disease in which the gray matter of the spinal
cord is attacked, producing destruction of certain cells and causing
paralysis. The disease is caused by a virus――tiny “bugs” smaller than
bacteria. Apparently these “bugs” enter through the mouth on food or in
water that has been contaminated in some fashion, or through the nose
in breathing. It is not conclusively known how the disease is spread.
Many people harbor the virus without any reaction whatsoever. Many
others have mild symptoms which they disregard as a summer cold. Once
symptoms have developed, special laboratory studies made by experts are
usually carried out to establish the diagnosis accurately.


                       _What are the_ SYMPTOMS?

There is no characteristic symptom or sign to be found in all cases.
This makes the diagnosis difficult. Quite frequently, the patient
cannot bend his head forward as far as usual. A doctor should
always be called if anyone in the family has a fever associated with a
bad headache, or with pain in the muscles in either the arms or legs or
in the neck and back. Even minor upsets in children should be looked
upon with suspicion. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, a slight cold coupled
with pain in the joints, are also possible danger signs. A child
catching polio may become drowsy or restless, feverish and irritable.
He may complain about and resist being moved. These symptoms are
particularly important during the summer and early fall months because
this is the period during which most outbreaks of polio occur.


                       _What is the_ TREATMENT?

If, during the course of an epidemic, any suspicious illness should
develop in a member of your family, prompt medical attention and
observation are important. If any sign or symptom of polio is
present, the affected person should be hospitalized immediately.
Hospitals have many special forms of equipment which are necessary in
treatment. Trained nursing care is essential. Should paralysis appear,
special measures are necessary to prevent or lessen deformity and to
begin the rebuilding of the affected parts of the body. No clearly
reliable specific drug is available as yet which will cure polio, but
gamma globulin appears to give some degree of protection for several
weeks against the paralysis stage of the disease. There are now strong
hopes that a vaccine is now available that will give immunity against
polio for a whole season.

_At the present time_ treatment of the disease takes many forms.
While a patient is recovering from a polio attack, a full nourishing
diet, application of various forms of heat and massage, special baths
and exercises, are the measures which are most helpful in restoring
usefulness to affected arms or legs. Specially built shoes or braces
are required in only a few cases, and surgical operations have been
devised to return motion and function to the arms or legs of some
patients.

_Treatment_ must be continued over long periods of time in some cases,
but the results are often very rewarding. The expense of such long
treatment is great. Fortunately, an awakened public, through its
contributions to the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and
other Agencies, has helped thousands to bear this expense. Support of
these organizations in their sincere and unselfish aims is a splendid
public service in the battle against polio.

                _How to GUARD against this DISEASE...._

Although there is no known means of vaccination or inoculation against
polio, many things can be done to lessen the possibility of getting the
disease.

_First_ of all, if an epidemic occurs, you should follow the
instructions of the local public health officer. He will also decide in
what cases gamma globulin is needed.

_Secondly_, it is wise to avoid crowded places, especially indoors
where there is opportunity for close contact and possible infection.

_In addition_, food and water should be obtained only from absolutely
reliable sources.

_Every_ effort should be made to insure that flies, mice, rats, and
other vermin are kept out of the home, as they are possible carriers of
infection.

_You_ and your children should get plenty of rest and wholesome food,
avoid over-exertion and excessive fatigue.

_Do not_ travel into areas where there is much polio or go swimming
when many cases have occurred in your locality.

_Further_, many physicians may advise postponing the removal of
tonsils, the extraction of teeth, or other operations in or about the
nose, throat, or mouth when the disease is prevalent in the community.

The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and other Agencies will
help polio patients as much as possible. But the best kind of help
is that which you, yourself, can give by taking every precaution to
keep the disease from striking anyone in your family. Proper rest, a
balanced diet, and moderate exercise in the fresh air and sunshine tone
up the body and help increase the system’s resistance to disease. By
following these and other common-sense rules of wholesome living, your
family will be taking a major step toward health and happiness.
